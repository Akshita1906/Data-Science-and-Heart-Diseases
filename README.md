# About

Elucidated the life cycle of any DataScience Project with the help of two Dataset, namely : 
* [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
by [Svetlana Ulianova](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova)
* [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) by [ronit](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf) based on an [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
